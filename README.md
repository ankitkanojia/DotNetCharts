### amChart Charts    
amCharts is a company based in Vilnius, Lithuania. The beginning of amCharts and amMap was in 2004 when the first version of amMap was created. Antanas Marcelionis worked as a manager in a web development company and, being a fan of maps and traveling, wanted to have a tool to work like a pin-map for him. So he made this tool in his free time. In 2006 Antanas left his job without any clear idea what he’ll do next. With the help of some friends he deepened his programming knowledge (programming was only a hobby since he knew Basic on the legendary Sinclair ZX Spectrum), and one day he decided to make a pie chart. It took several months to release the first version of the pie chart. And then it all happened almost like in this Dilbert comic strip.
